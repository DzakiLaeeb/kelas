### Plan for UI Improvements

1. **Enhance Button Styles**:
   - Improve the delete button with more distinct hover effects.
   - Consider adding a confirmation modal for deletion to prevent accidental deletions.

2. **Improve Search Bar**:
   - Make the search input field more prominent by increasing padding and adjusting the border.
   - Style the search button to stand out more, possibly by changing its color or adding an icon.

3. **Table Styling**:
   - Implement alternating row colors in the customer table for better readability.
   - Add padding to table cells for improved spacing.

4. **Alert Messages**:
   - Style the success and error alert messages to be more visually distinct, using colors that align with the overall theme.

5. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensure that the layout is fully responsive, especially for mobile devices, by testing the design on various screen sizes.

### Follow-Up Steps
- After implementing the changes, test the functionality to ensure everything works as expected.
- Verify that the UI improvements enhance the user experience.
